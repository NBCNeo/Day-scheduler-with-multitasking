The only problem was that the time taken for the completion of all tasks slightly increased compared to the one without multitasking. That was not optimal solution and was less efficient. I tried the function with a few different data sets, and got similar results. There might be certain kinds of data for which the time duration will decrease, but I could not find them.\n",

If it is possible, we check the next task in the queue and see if it can also be multitasked. If both of them can be multitasked, we can perform them together. If not, we move forward with the regular performance.\n",

    "First, I tried to go through all the tasks in the priority queue, and check if either of them could be multitasked. And, if there were any tasks that could be multitasked, they were performed together. But, this created unusual results because the order of tasks were sometimes bizarre.\n",

    "Looking at the code with and without multitasking, it is clear that the one using multitasking is much efficient and takes much less time to complete the exact same tasks. The tasks that started at 7 AM was completed at 4:35 pm without multitasking and at 3:10 PM with multitasking.\n",

    "Using heaps to get the tasks that are on the top of the priority means that there is some influence of the order of input of tasks if multiple tasks have the same priority. But, the way we use dependencies enables us to set some deterministic quality over the way these activities will be conducted. Also, if there are some strict order with which tasks needs to be performed, we can manipulate their dependencies for our advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is formatted in a way that is easy to read and understand. For example: every time we multitask, the tasks that are being multitasked are printed together. This way we can see if there are any incompatiable tasks that are being performed simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, although unlikely, there might be cases when the two prioritized tasks can be multitasked together but are not compatiable. For this, we need to tailor the dependencies carefully increasing the amount of pre processing required by the inputs. One way can be to set certain constraints on the task IDs, so they cannot be performed with other specific tasks. The running time, space complexity and the optimal schedule can be further improved upon as well. We can use additional conditional statements so that we need not heapify the array on every single iteration. Also, we can explore complex ways to multitask more than two tasks at the same time."
